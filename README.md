## Write it green - ESG sentiment analysis of annual reports and news articles

This repository contains all code to my Master's thesis at WU. I may not be that proud of it, but I still think it belongs here. The code is chaotic and couldn't be bothered to make it nice and clean it up once I submitted my thesis. It was time to start working on something better.

The important data that I used can be obtained elsewhere:

- I have used the Baier, Berninger and Kiesel ESG wordlist available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HlB41wwdlOtci-DtPvfXSeWBM__Or5PT.
- I have also used the Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment word list available at https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/.

- Finally and most importantly, you can find the annual company reports and news articles I have used at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IrJvuBe51x4hVFQJwAZrs0Wvc0-ytlhk?usp=share_link. It contains all annual reports of the EURO STOXX 50 companies between 2015 and 2022 downloaded from their websites, as well as relevant news articles about ESG and those companies scraped from Factiva.
