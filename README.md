## Write it green - ESG sentiment analysis of annual reports and news articles

This repository contains all code to my Master's thesis at WU. I may not be that proud of it, but I still think it belongs here. The code is chaotic and couldn't be bothered to make it nice and clean it up once I submitted my thesis. It was time to start working on something better.

The important data that I used can be obtained elsewhere:

- I have used the Baier, Berninger and Kiesel ESG wordlist available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HlB41wwdlOtci-DtPvfXSeWBM__Or5PT
- I have also used the Loughran-McDonald financial sentiment word list available at https://sraf.nd.edu/loughranmcdonald-master-dictionary/

Information about my data coming soon.
